## ip command practice

### Introduction

Package name: iproute

the interface configuration files into /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
the interface active settings were shown /sys/class/net/
the interfaca configuration files were named ifcfg-IFNAME

Network interface name has rules:

Ethernet card: eth0 ... ethX
Wireless card: wlan0 ... wlanX

but from 6.1

the biosdevname command refer the interface name from BIOS

PCI X slot Y port: pXpY

Device depended on: emX

### Configuration files

```bash
# vim /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

#Device Control
DEVICE=eth0
ONBOOT=yes
NM_CONTROLLED=yes
MACADDR=MAS_ADDRESS - changeable
HWADDR=DEVICE_ADDRESS

#DHCP ip addressing
BOOTPROTO=dhcp

#Alternative static ip addressing
BOOTPROTO=static
IPADDR=192.168.1.11
PREFIX=24
GATEWAY=192.168.1.1
DNS1=192.168.1.22

# Default MTU
MTU=1500
```

### NetworkManager

Default service on RHEL6, and if you need to manage the configuration files individually you shoud NM_CONTROLLED=no

You can start and stop manually the interfaces with ifup and ifdown command.

```bash
-- stop
# ifdown eth0

-- start
# ifup eth0
-- restart
# ifdown eth0; ifup eth0

-- or if you need to restart all interfaces as follows
# systemctl restart network or service network restart

```

## ip command

ip command shows the current interface states and IP addresses

ip link : modify L2 settings, such as MAC addresses, promiscuous mode and interface up and down
ip link show 
ip link set DEVICE up | down
ip link set DEVICE promisc on | off
ip link set DEVICE address ADDRESS

ip address : modify L3 settins, such as IP addresses
ip address show dev DEVICE
ip address show flush dev DEVICE
ip address add IPADDR dev DEVICE
ip address del IPADDR dev DEVICE

ip route add default via IPADDR

```bash
# ip -4 addr show eth0

# ip link show eth0

# ip address flush eth0

# ip address add 192.168.123/24 dev eth0

# ip link set dev eth0 up

# ip route add default via 192.168.123.254
```
# ethtool command

check the device type

```bash
# ethtool -i eth0
```
