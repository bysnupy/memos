## Practices

* Managing with brctl CLI.

```bash
-- create the virtual bridge br01
# brctl addbr br01

# brctl show br01
bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
br01            8000.000000000000       no

-- attaching the interface to bridge
# ip address flush eth0
# brctl addif br01 eth0

-- The bridges that attach internal interfaces can have IP addresses.
# ip address add 192.168.124.108/24 dev br01

# ip link set dev br01 up

# ip route add default via 192.168.124.254

```

* Configuring persistently

interface config file: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0

```ini
DEVICE=eth0
BRIDGE=br01
ONBOOT=yes
```

bridge config file: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br01

```ini
DEVICE=br01
TYPE=Bridge
IPADDR=192.168.124.108
PREFIX=24
GATEWAY=192.168.124.254
ONBOOT=yes
```
