## How CommitLimit affect the Swap occurrence is not so much?

### Test patterns

1. CommitLimit < Total Memory, and allocated nearly total memory.
2. CommitLimit > Total Memory, and allocated nearly total memory.
3. After disabling overcommit feature, allocated more memories than CommitLimit.
4. CommitLimit < Total Memory, and allocated nearly total memory as virtual memory only.
5. The overcommit and heuristic overcommit take turns to allocate more memory than physical memory.

#### 3. After disabling overcommit feature, allocated more memories than CommitLimit.

After taking effect as vm.overcommit_memory = 2, this pattern has failed memory allocation.

#### 4. CommitLimit < Total Memory, and allocated nearly total memory as virtual memory only.

#### 5. The overcommit and heuristic overcommit take turns to allocate more memory than physical memory + swap memory.

Both vm.overcommit_memory = 0 and vm.overcommit_memory = 1 are failed to allocating memory, but each result was different.
vm.overcommit_memory = 0 has terminated before allocating the memory, but vm.overcommit_memory = 1 was killed by OOM killer (it has allocated the memory probably)

### Conclusion

CommitLimit was not a single factor causing swap paging, instead Commited_As ratio against Total memory was more important one.
but if overcommit feature is disabled, CommitLimit is real limitation regardless total memory size.
