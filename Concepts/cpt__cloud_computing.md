## Cloud computing definition

Cloud computing is a model for enabling on-demand network access to a shared resource pool of configurable computing resources, such as servers, storage, networks, applications, services and so on. These resources can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal effort . A self-service user is able to launch as many servers, in the form of virtual machines or instances, as needed, without requiring assistance from the service provider. The cloud consumer decides which computing resources to use for their instances. Cloud computing services have several common characteristics:

Self-service
Multi-tenancy
Elasticity
Telemetry

* Cloud Types: Public, Private, Hybrid clouds

* Cloud Models: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, CaaS, FaaS
