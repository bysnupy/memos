## Virtual machine and Container

### Virtual Machine

Virtualization machine is comprised of a server to contain image files, it's treated as a self-contained server, or virtual machine. Each VM runs its OS. The virtual machines run on virtual hardware, defined and emulated by the host system. These virtual machines are isolated from each other. From the perspective of each operating system, it is running on its own private hardware. They may have their own network and IP addresses, file systems, peripherals and so on.
Virtualization technical skill is accomplished by using a hypervisor. A hypervisor is the software that manages and supports the virtualization environment. It runs the virtual machines for each OS, providing access to virtual hardware emulated from virtualization technician.

### Container

A container technician is comprised of an OS process or process tree to run isolated from other processes provised by the same operating system. Containers can quickly scale by creating new instances of an containerized application.

The container solutions create an runtime environment isolated from outside of its container. If the application requires access to something external of the container, you can access through networks, as if separated physical servers.

Each container has an exclusive virtual nic and private IP addresses which allow it accessing external networks. Containers can be used by deploying an application and its dependencies as self-contained units, without interference, dependency problems and conflicts.
