## Software Defined Networking

### Introduction

Software-defined networking (SDN) is a networking model to manage network services through the abstraction layers. SDN decouples with the software called the control plane, and the underlying mechanisms that route the traffic and packet control, called the data plane. SDN enables communication between the control plane and the data plane. For example, the OpenFlow, OpenDaylight.

SDN does not change the underlying protocols used in networking rather, it enables the utilization of application knowledge to provision networks. Networking protocols, such as TCP/IP and Ethernet standards, rely on manual configuration by administrators for applications. They do not manage networking applications, such as their network usage, the end point requirements, or how much and how fast the data needs to be transferred. The goal of SDN is to extract knowledge of how an application is being used by the application administrator or the application's configuration data itself.
