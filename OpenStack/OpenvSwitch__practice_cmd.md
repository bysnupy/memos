* Practices

```bash
-- enabling and starting the Open vSwitch service
# systemctl enable openvswitch
# systemctl start openvswitch

-- create the new bridge
# ovs-vsctl add-br ovs-br1

-- the interface L3 settings should flush to attach the bridge
# ip address flush dev enp0s8

-- assign the IP address to the bridge
# ip address add 192.168.124.109/24 dev ovs-br1

-- attach the interface to the bridge
# ovs-vsctl add-port ovs-br1 enp0s8

-- bring the bridge up
# ip link set dev ovs-br1 up

-- check the settings

    Bridge "ovs-br1"
        Port "enp0s8"
            Interface "enp0s8"
        Port "ovs-br1"
            Interface "ovs-br1"
                type: internal
    ovs_version: "2.6.1"

-- check the L3 configurations
# ip address show ovs-br1

-- setting up the default gateway
# ip route add default via 192.168.124.254

-- check the flow mode
# ovs-ofctl dump-flows ovs-br1
