## Provisioning preview

### Introduction

I have managed many VMs on the various environments, and the resource (compute, storage and so on) is going to increase more and more in the future.
But we have not much engineer and time to deploy various resources, and we had to automated these tasks.
Here, I will take notes about my challenge or practice for automated provisioning of various layers.

### Provisioning layes
